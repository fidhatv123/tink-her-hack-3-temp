### Project Description
This project acts as a primary source of communication between the hackathon organisers and participants.

### The Problem Statement
Hackathons are exciting events where innovation thrives, but managing them can be chaotic. Organizers struggle with handling registrations, team formations, schedule coordination, project submissions, and judging processes all at once. Participants also face challenges finding teams, tracking event details, and submitting their projects seamlessly. Our goal is to streamline these processes into one unified platform that makes managing and participating in hackathons easier, smoother, and more fun!

### The Solution
Our hackathon management platform is designed to simplify and enhance the experience for both organizers and participants. It offers a centralized dashboard where organizers can manage registrations, track team formations, schedule events, and streamline project submissions and judging. For participants, the platform enables easy event notifications, and submission trackingâ€”all in one place. By automating key processes and providing a user-friendly interface, we eliminate the administrative hassle, allowing everyone to focus on what matters most: creating and innovating. Whether youâ€™re organizing or participating, this platform makes hackathons more efficient, collaborative, and enjoyable for all involved.
